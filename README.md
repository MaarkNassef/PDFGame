# PDFGame

### Description:
This project is a web application built using the Flask framework that allows users to upload a PDF file containing text and converts it into a new PDF file where each page of the original PDF is represented as an image. The application uses the PyMuPDF library to read and convert the text pages into images and also to write the new PDF file. Users can upload a PDF file via a web form, and then download the resulting PDF file containing the text pages as images. This application can be useful for situations where the original PDF file needs to be kept confidential, or when the text needs to be extracted using OCR.
